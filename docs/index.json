Tether like structures are observed in our experiments. This is mostly dependent on the actin network of the cytoskeleton of cells, and how myosin helps in reorganization of the actin network.\nFigure : Shows a tissue cell adhered to the cover glass and optical handles attached to the cell membrane The curious case of red blood cells (RBCs) #Human Red Blood Cells (also known as RBCs) are a cruial component of blood. These cells travel through blood capillaries which are much smaller than their typical size, so they are highly deformable.
