Again, welcome to my website.\nI am a second-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I work in the field of Soft Matter Physics in the Soft \u0026amp; Active Matter Lab under the supervision of Dr. Manas Khan. My current research aims to identify and address the similarities between biological and colloidal membranes and design artificial membranes with bioengineered colloids.\nBesides my research, I also paint watercolor landscapes, though I do not find much time. Sometimes, I also play football and watch animes.\nEducation #  Ph.D. (Ongoing) - Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India. M.Sc.
