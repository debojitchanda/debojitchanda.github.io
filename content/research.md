## Research Projects
I am currently working in the following projects.

### Crystallization of asymmetric colloids

Here, we study the crystallization process of square-shaped Brownian particles. These particles interact via hard-sphere interaction and crystallizes with various symmetries under osmotic compression.

_Figure: Shows a two-dimensional colloidal assembly of square-shaped particles._


### Mechanical properties of tissue cells
We study the mechanical response of tissue cells by stretching them with optical tweezers. Tether like structures are observed in our experiments.
