## Research Projects
I am currently working in the following projects.

### Crystallization of asymmetric colloids
We study the crystallization process of square-shaped Brownian particles. These particles interact via hard-sphere interaction and crystallizes with various symmetries under osmotic compression. Both translational and orientational fluctuations need to be taken into account to understand the crystallization dynamics.

### Mechanical properties of tissue cells
We study the mechanical response of tissue cells by stretching them with optical tweezers. Tether like structures are observed in our experiments. This is mostly dependent on the actin network of the cytoskeleton of cells, and how myosin helps in reorganization of the actin network.
