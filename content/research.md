## Research Projects

I am currently working in the following projects.

### Crystallization of asymmetric colloids

We study the crystallization process of rounded square-shaped Brownian particles. These particles interact via hard-sphere interaction and crystallizes with various symmetries under osmotic compression. Both translational and orientational fluctuations need to be taken into account to understand the crystallization dynamics.

### Defect dynamics in crystals of asymmetric colloids

We study how a mono-vacancy defect moves in a entroipc crystal of rounded square particles. The system is similar to above.

### Mechanical properties of tissue cells

We study the mechanical response of tissue cells by stretching them with optical tweezers. Tether like structures are observed in our experiments. This is mostly dependent on the actin network of the cytoskeleton of cells, and how myosin helps in reorganization of the actin network.

### The curious case of red blood cells (RBCs)

Human Red Blood Cells (also known as RBCs) are a cruial component of blood. These cells travel through blood capillaries which are much smaller than their typical size, so they are highly deformable. We study the deformibility of RBCs using optical tweezer based force-elongation measurements.
